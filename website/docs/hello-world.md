# Hello World

## What?!

I have traced the Rebel spies to her.
Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money. A tremor in the Force.
The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
He is here.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
You mean it controls your actions?
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

Hey, Luke!
May the Force be with you.

1. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

2. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more likeâ€¦suicide.

3. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

He is here.

## The Force

The Force is strong with this one.
I have you now.
I care.
So, what do you think of her, Han?
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

- Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
- You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!
- He is here.

Don't underestimate the Force.
I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.

You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor!
Take her away!
Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.
Don't underestimate the Force.
I want to come with you to Alderaan.
There's nothing for me here now.
I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

What?! Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
You don't believe in the Force, do you? What!?

Obi-Wan is here.
The Force is with him.
Oh God, my uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--

I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.
I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
I don't know, what do you think?
A tremor in the Force.
The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.

This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
Escape is not his plan.

I must face him, alone.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
I can't get involved!
I've got work to do!
It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now.
It's such a long way from here.

The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.
Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander.

There'll be no one to stop us this time!

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.
I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.

Oh God, my uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?
Don't underestimate the Force.
I'm trying not to, kid.

Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
